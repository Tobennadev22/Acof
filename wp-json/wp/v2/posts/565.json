I was a quiet and timid, but unmotivated student. I loved school and learning, but serious thoughts about doing well and about my future were very separate from my reality; I didn\u2019t see a future in academia, and especially not in the legal field. As a young, black female, under-representation in the legal field made me hesitant about whether I belonged in these spaces. I also wasn\u2019t sure that I wanted to attend university and considered \u201ceasier\u201d routes that I thought someone with my background, would \u2018suit better.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>However, LAWS staff, teachers and volunteers\u00a0introduced me to topics like social justice, law, and politics. Through exploring these topics, my passion and interest grew, and I was able to see how valuable diversity in perspectives was. I also had the opportunity to attend conferences, courthouses, and law-firms where I met individuals who motivated me to consider a future for myself in the legal field which I was fascinated by.<\/p>\n<p>I then decided \u2013 quite prematurely \u2013 that I wanted to attend McGill University. I didn\u2019t have particularly amazing marks, I didn\u2019t have the most volunteer hours, I didn\u2019t have anything that I thought a university with the reputation like McGill, would want. But in my final years, though I faced many challenges in and outside of school, I focused and studied through these difficult times and finally, I applied and was accepted to McGill for my Bachelor of Arts. Becoming a LAWS student opened me up to an interesting world of possibilities, gave me amazing opportunities, and made me discover the potential of a future of doing something that I am passionate about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Written by Dejah Brown When I was in grade 9 at Central Tech, I was unsure of whether to join LAWS.
