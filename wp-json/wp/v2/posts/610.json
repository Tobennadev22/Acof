Tell us about yourself. What makes you you?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I attribute a lot of who I am as a person to my upbringing. Growing up in the C.W. Jefferys neighbourhood taught me my values, my ethics, and my mannerisms. I try to never forget where I came from, and I&#8217;m proud to be from this area. With regard to my interests, I love basketball, fitness, and movies. With regard to my personality, I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s always trying to crack jokes, lighten the mood, and see things differently, which allows me to maintain a drive to succeed while still remaining calm, cool, and collected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to join LAWS?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not to use a cliche, but from a young age I&#8217;ve always wanted to go into law. I didn&#8217;t really have a grasp on what it meant to be a lawyer or what the process was to become a lawyer, and as such, I started to stray away from this career path. I actually left my home school of C.W. Jefferys in Grade 9 to join the HMST program at Northview, but I didn&#8217;t feel fulfilled there and my cousin at C.W. Jefferys informed me about this new program that was starting and I decided to switch back and experience something new and revitalize my interest in the law.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are some of your favourite or most valued moments from the program?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My absolute favourite moments from the program are the connections I was able to make with mentors, several of which I still keep in touch with to this day. Having access to someone who is further down the path you&#8217;re embarking on is an invaluable asset and I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve made it to where I am now without the guidance provided by everyone who was willing to help me on my journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are you up to now?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently at Osgoode Hall Law School, at York University, as a first-year law student.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your future goals and aspirations?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As far as my professional goals, I hope to become partner at a large multi-service firm. I want to use my position of power and privilege to help enact initiatives to broaden diversity and inclusion in the legal arena, and open avenues to encourage more youth from underprivileged neighbourhoods to pursue a legal education.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did LAWS impact your life\/career choices?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before LAWS I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure of which career I wanted to pursue and I felt a little lost, but through the multitude of experiences provided by the LAWS program I felt confident in pursuing a legal career after high school. The LAWS program&#8217;s impact didn&#8217;t stop after I left the program however, as I was able to benefit from so many alumni initiatives, such as the mentoring program and the LSAP program, which were imperative in obtaining an entrance to Osgoode Hall Law School. I can genuinely attribute my drive to pursue a legal career to the LAWS program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you meet any mentors or role models that inspired you along the way?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The mentors who have had the greatest impact on my legal career are definitely Noah Burshtein and Christopher Savo from BLG, who continuously go out of their way to ensure that I stay on track. Additionally, I&#8217;d love to give a huge shout out to Eleonora who has been a mentor since I was in high school and has consistently been a source of positivity and assistance throughout the entire process of becoming a law student.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to students who are considering signing up for LAWS?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LAWS is not a program where you are forced or expected to pursue a legal career. Although the curriculum somewhat shifts to a legal-oriented focus, LAWS is committed to helping students pursue any form of education and providing support to ensure students succeed. I think anyone who is considering signing up for LAWS should give it a chance, as it is an immersive experience that will change the way you see the world, regardless of what you do with that information afterwards.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basics.
