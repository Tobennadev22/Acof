Students gain a unique view of the Canadian legal system at work, spend time with positive professional role models, and are exposed to the wide range of justice careers available to them after graduation. Stephanie, a grade 10 student at Central Tech said that&nbsp; &ldquo;job shadowing a duty counsel was fantastic &ndash; seeing and hearing all the things they do and knowing that could be me in a couple&nbsp;of&nbsp;years&hellip;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s that spark of interest that can often lead to exploring other opportunities for further studies at school and even after graduation. &ldquo;The Court Experience Program is a wonderful example of the unique learning opportunities the legal profession can offer to young people by working with local high schools&rdquo;, said Alexis Archbold, Director of the <span class=\"caps\">LAWS<\/span> program. &ldquo;Many of our participating students have decided that they want to study law after spending a day with a legal professional&nbsp;in&nbsp;court&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Held in the beautiful and historic court room 121 at Old City Hall court house, the special reception featured speeches from students, court house volunteers and the former Chief Justice R. Roy McMurtry, who praised the Court Experience Program for partnering the legal profession with local secondary schools to help young people learn about the legal system. Jutice McMurtry was on hand after the ceremony to meet parents and have his photo taken with several students. Each participating student received a certificate of participation stamped with the official seal of the Ontario Court&nbsp;of&nbsp;Justice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LAWS was recently featured on the Toronto District School&nbsp;Board&rsquo;s&nbsp;website<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Court Experience Program Celebrated!
