I LOVE working with\u00a0young people\/youth\/kids.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>2. I want to\u00a0give back to my community. I don&#8217;t have huge amounts of money or prestige, but when I walk into a high school classroom, I know I am sharing something extremely valuable that I do have a lot of &#8211; experience.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<div>3. I want to be a part of\u00a0increasing diversity\u00a0in law schools and the legal profession. As per point #2, I am lacking in some of the &#8220;big, powerful&#8221; resources that tend to wield influence. However, I believe that one of the most effective ways we can increase diversity is by showing young people that the path to law school\/professional school\/university is available to them and a possibility they can seize. My way of doing this is standing up in front of a group of Toronto high school students, sharing my own post-high school path and delivering the message &#8220;I did this and I know that if you want to, you can do this too.&#8221;<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><em>Christina Roussakis is a 3L student at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, currently on exchange in France.<\/em><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are many meaningful opportunities at law school.
