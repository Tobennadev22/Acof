The Vital People grant program recognizes valued leaders who are making outstanding contributions working at not-for-profit organizations. Grants are awarded in support of continued training and professional development of the selected leaders. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are proud to celebrate these inspiring leaders that are building Toronto into the city we all want,&rdquo; said Rahul K. Bhardwaj, Toronto Community Foundation, President &amp; CEO. &ldquo;The vitality and well-being of our city counts on individuals who take initiative, make a positive contribution and demonstrate leadership.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This Vital Fund Award is recognition of LAWS&rsquo; role in supporting the long-term vitality of Toronto. Rooted in the justice sector and using the law to engage students, LAWS works to level playing fields, address inequity, reduce barriers, and encourage a wide diversity of youth to become active, engaged citizens, and to set high expectations for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>The grant enabled Sarah to attend the Global Alliance of Justice Education Global Conference in New Delhi in December and present on LAWS&rsquo; innovative program model and its collaborative program partnerships with Faculty programs such as the Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights and the International Human Rights Program, that bring law students and LAWS high schools studies together to examine international issues and the meaning of global citizenship. The grant will also facilitate Sarah&rsquo;s attendance at Harvard&rsquo;s Strategic Management Program for Leaders of Non-Governmental Organizations in Turkey during the spring.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LAWS Director Sarah Pole has been awarded a 2014 Vital People Grant&nbsp;from the Toronto Community Foundation.
