Jefferys and Westview Centnnial Secondary School had the opportunity to join the program for the first time.\u00a0 Both schools are composed of students who reside\u00a0primarily in the Jane-Finch corridor and are eager to explore new opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Radhika Sharma was one of those students.\u00a0 &#8220;The LAWS program has been invaluable to me,&#8221; Rahika states.\u00a0&#8220;The program provided a gateway of opportunities to students like me who were situated in a low-income neighbourhood where there weren\u2019t many opportunities or resources available to pursue\u00a0post-secondary education.&#8221;\u00a0 While in high school, Radhika\u00a0got her first summer job through LAWS where she was placed at the Law Commission of Ontario (LCO). While shadowing the lawyers and the law students at the LCO, she was inspired to pursue\u00a0legal education.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After graduating high school, Radhika was offered employment at the LCO, where she worked for four years while completing her undergraduate degree in Political Science at York University.\u00a0\u00a0With the help of the LCO staff and students, as well as the free Law School Access Program at the University of Toronto Facutly of Law, Radhika was able to successfully\u00a0navigate the law school application process.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Radhika is now proud to join the 1L class at Osgoode.\u00a0 She has worked really hard along the way and persevered.\u00a0 &#8220;Essentially, if I had not joined the LAWS program, I may have succumbed to the reality that many of my peers faced &#8211; that of having no guidance as to how to pave a path towards\u00a0legal education. For that, I am thankful!&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following LAWS&#8217; expansion to Osgoode Hall Law School in 2011, students from both C.W.
