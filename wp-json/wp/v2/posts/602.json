I\u2019m 21 years old. I immigrated to Canada from Jamaica when I was 3 years old. Since then, I have lived in and around the Jane and Finch community. I like to describe myself as an outspoken, fierce and intelligent lady. What makes me, me is my ability to speak my mind (in a respectful way, of course), regardless of what others may think about it.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"1165483811\">\n<div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1165483811 c118\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitle exportItemTitle freebirdCustomFont\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1165483811 c118\"><strong>Why did you decide to join LAWS?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">I was first introduced to the LAWS program when I was in grade eight. They had hosted a Mock Trial activity at a summer program that I was attending. I don\u2019t remember what the Mock Trial was about but I vividly recall the debrief session that we had after. I remember it vividly because it was the most frustrated I had ever been in my thirteen years of life. The facilitators encouraged everyone to share their thoughts and opinions and of course, I had an opinion and I believed my opinion was the only true and correct one. The conversation had gone around and around in circles for almost thirty minutes. When I went home that night, I remember telling myself that I NEEDED to be a part of this program in high school. Although the conversation was frustrating, I appreciated that we were able to have the conversation in the first place. It was thought-provoking in the sense that it forced me to analyze my beliefs and biases while encouraging friendly debate.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"688970985\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\">\n<div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.688970985 c121\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitle exportItemTitle freebirdCustomFont\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.688970985 c121\"><strong>What are some of your favourite or most valued moments from the program?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">One of my favourite memories in the LAWS program include the Court Experience Program that I was fortunate enough to attend in grade ten. In this program, myself and one of my peers had the opportunity to spend a day in court. We spent the day touring holding cells and then shadowing different members of the court system (i.e. Justice of the Peace, Judge), and sitting in on trials. Another memory that I am extremely fond of is having the opportunity to work in a law firm in Downtown, Toronto as my FIRST JOB. How many people can say that their first job was at a law firm? This is the opportunity that solidified my decision to go to law school. (Fun fact: they filmed the show &#8220;Suits&#8221; at this law firm!!)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"1886691488\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\">\n<div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1886691488 c124\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitle exportItemTitle freebirdCustomFont\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1886691488 c124\"><strong>What are you up to now?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">Currently, I am in my fourth and final year of completing my undergraduate degree at Brock University. I am studying Sociology with a Concentration in Criminology and a minor in Political Science. As well, I am working part-time for the Government of Canada while patiently (but anxiously) waiting to hear back about admission to law school!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"190184632\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\">\n<div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.190184632 c127\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitle exportItemTitle freebirdCustomFont\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.190184632 c127\"><strong>What are your future goals and aspirations?<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">My future goals and aspirations include becoming a lawyer. The kind of law that I would like to practice is undetermined. However, I am passionate about human rights. As an individual who was raised in the Jane and Finch community, I have watched as my peers and those close to me have been labelled and stigmatized solely based on where they grew up. I can empathize with people who perceive the Jane and Finch community as a crime-ridden, gang-populated area \u2013 it is all they are shown. However, the label and the stigma that come with it are not the whole story. As a lawyer, I will fight to prove that low-income communities, as well as individuals who come from these communities, work hard every day with the resources that are available. However, they deserve better and more than what they are often given.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"1262636635\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitle exportItemTitle freebirdCustomFont\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1262636635 c130\"><strong>How did LAWS impact your life\/career choices?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">LAWS impacted my career and life choices by firstly inspiring me to become a lawyer, and then providing me with the resources necessary to become a lawyer. Prior to being introduced to the LAWS program, lawyers were only people that I saw on TV. I never thought that I could actually become one. However, after having the opportunity to participate in things like the Court Experience Program, Mock Trials, mentorship opportunities, as well as working at an actual law firm, that goal did not seem unattainable.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"349375587\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\">\n<div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.349375587 c133\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitle exportItemTitle freebirdCustomFont\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.349375587 c133\"><strong>Did you meet any mentors or role models that inspired you along the way?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">YES! I have had the great honour of meeting Jackie VanDerMeulen at the Fasken mentoring partnership with LAWS. (This is a picture of her and I at my LAWS graduation in grade 12!). She is kind, generous and overall, an amazing human being. Because of her, I was able to secure a position at Fasken as a Summer Administration Student. As well, Jackie has played a HUGE role in my journey to law school. From providing me with advice about law schools to editing my personal statement, she has been there and I am extremely grateful to have her in my life.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"1358816741\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\">\n<div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1358816741 c136\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitle exportItemTitle freebirdCustomFont\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1358816741 c136\"><strong>What advice would you give to students who are considering signing up for LAWS?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">DO.

The LAWS program is filled with individuals who truly want to see you succeed. Even now, years after I graduated from Westview Centennial, Eleonora and everyone at LAWS are always doing what that they can to support me. I am forever grateful to have LAWS in my life and if you give it a chance, you will be too.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basics.
